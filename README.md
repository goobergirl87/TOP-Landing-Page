# TOP-Landing-Page

After finishing the CSS foundations section and the topic Flexbox, I entered the second project of The Odin Project. A webpage that actually had the potential to be on the live web compared to my early recipes page. This time TOP gave an example how the page should look like, and how it should behave. You get encouraged to google your way through the process, if you’re stuck. And don’t you dare, look up other’s students solutions! Flexbox can be challenging, but once I got the concept, my gratitude rose. This project was a great teacher in learning the making of a classical layout and repetitive structures on the web.
